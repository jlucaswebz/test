		<h1>Who I Am</h1>
		<h2>"Really" it's all true!!</h2>

		<p> I was born back with the dinosaurs!  I rode one to school even.  He was a brontosaurus named Turtle!</p>
		<p>OK so maybe I'm not really <em><strong>THAT</strong></em> old, but some days I feel like I am.
		</p>
		<p>I moved to CA in October from Washington state to take on my nephew after his mother was murdered. He is 12 going on 30!</p>

		<p>In Washington I went to school at Olympic College and just graduated in June with my AAS.</p>
		<p>At OC I took a lot of programming classes that included:

		<ul>
			<li>ASP.NET</li>
			<li>JAVA</li>
			<li>ANDROID </li>
			<li>C, C++ and C#</li>
			<li>HTML</li>
			<li>CSS</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p>While I  am absolutely enjoying this class, I do really want to get to work, so I hope to sped things up and get a job soon!</p>

		<p>In that vein...here is my contact number!  559-387-89................Not really!!!</p>
